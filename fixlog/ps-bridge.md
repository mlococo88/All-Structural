# Fix log — apps/ps-bridge/ (Prestressed Bridge Design, rebuild)

The rebuild of `Prestressed Bridge Design.html` as a folder app built like the Steel Bridge app (`docs/ps-bridge-plan.md`; engineer
decisions PS-1 to PS-14, 2026-11-12). Folder: `apps/ps-bridge/` (`index.html`, `engine/`, `ui/`, `report/`). Loads no `shared/` file yet.
Tests: `node tests/engine/run.mjs psbridge`; `node tests/smoke/ps-bridge-skeleton.mjs`. The old `Prestressed Bridge Design.html` is
unchanged and stays the working tool until the switch-over.

## 2026-11-12 — PR 1: ps-bridge-skeleton — folder, shell, tabs (placeholders), project model psb2.project v1 (new files)
PR: (link added below)
### Where
- `apps/ps-bridge/index.html` (new): the Steel Bridge shell (header, check summary column from 1200 px, input panel, splitter from
  900 px, output panel; stacked below 900 px), the CBUST `document.write` loader of classic scripts with `?v=<lastModified>`, KaTeX 0.16.9 and
  three.js r128 + OrbitControls 0.128.0 at the steel app's pinned URLs (no new library; used from PR 2b / 3c). Input tabs (plan §2.2):
  Project · Bridge layout · Cross-section · Girders & strands · Materials · Diaphragms / deck · Loads · Owner rules · Auto design. Output tabs
  (plan §2.3): Summary · Section properties · Loads & LLDF · Analysis · Losses · Stresses · Flexure · Shear · End zone & hold-down · Camber &
  deflection · Handling · Deck · Rating · Report · Drawings · Auto design · 3D view. Editable now: project information, spans and continuity,
  support skews, girder count, bays (unequal allowed), overhangs; every other card is a placeholder naming its contents and its PR. Export
  JSON (`<name>.psb2.json`), Import JSON, New. Input errors mark their field, count on their tab and are listed (with links) on the output
  panel and in the check summary column.
- `apps/ps-bridge/engine/model.js` (new, `window.PSBModel`): schema `psb2.project` v1 `{ project, spans{lengths, continuity 'simple' |
  'composite'}, xs{nb, bays, ohL, ohR, skews} }`; `defaultProject` (120 ft simple span, 5 girders at 9.0 ft, 3.0 ft overhangs, no skew: the
  old app's default L, S, girder count and overhang), `validate` (errors by path), `migrate` (none yet), `legacyKind` (an old Prestressed
  Bridge Design Export JSON / bridge file is recognised and refused with "imported in a later version"; nothing changed), `exportJSON`,
  `importJSON`, `save`, `load` (an unreadable saved project is copied to `psb2.project.unreadable.<ISO time>` first; if that copy fails,
  autosave stays off), `totalLength`, `girderOffsets` (display).
- `apps/ps-bridge/ui/dash.js` (new, `window.PSBDashUI`): the check summary column; each planned check group "not run" with its PR, or the
  input errors as links.
- `apps/ps-bridge/report/sections.js` (new, `window.PSBReportPlan`): the planned report sections, listed on the Report tab.
- `tools.html`: card "Prestressed Bridge Design (new, in development)", after the old app's card, "Not for design use yet" (the steel app's
  precedent, #465); entry in `fixlog/tools.md`.
### Copies from the Steel Bridge app (to move to shared/ later, CLAUDE.md §3)
- `apps/ps-bridge/ui/splitter.js` = `apps/steel-bridge/ui/splitter.js` at `d4e0d2b`, changed only in: namespace `PSBSplitUI`, UI key
  `psb2.splitRatio_v1`, event `psb2:panelresize`.
- The shell CSS in `apps/ps-bridge/index.html` = `apps/steel-bridge/index.html` `<style>` at `1c75fcc` without its tab-specific rules
  (the `.fRow:has(...)` steel field rules, the report, 3D bar, framing plan, hand-offs card and saved-projects dialog rules).
- `apps/ps-bridge/ui/dash.js`: adapted from `apps/steel-bridge/ui/dash.js` (head, « / » toggle, chip and error layout, same CSS classes).
- The page controller pattern (inline script: `num`/`sel`/`card` helpers, `panes()`, `drawInputs`, error marks and counts, `exportFile`)
  follows `apps/steel-bridge/index.html`; written for this app.
### Saved data (CLAUDE.md §5)
- New keys only: `psb2.project.current` (autosave), `psb2.project.unreadable.<ISO time>` (backup of an unreadable project), `psb2.ui` (tab
  choices), `psb2.splitRatio_v1`, `psb2.dashCollapsed_v1` (per-browser UI). Reserved in `KEYS` for a later PR: `psb2.lib.index`,
  `psb2.lib.p.<id>`, `psb2.lib.current`. `psb2.` was used by no tool (checked). No `psbeam.*`, `sbd2.*` or other key is read or written.
### Governing provisions
- None: no calculation. The continuity choice "made continuous for composite loads" names AASHTO LRFD 10th Ed. (2024) 5.12.3.3 as the old
  app's `cont.on` (PS-7); nothing uses it yet.
### Check case
- Default project: valid; total length 120 ft; girder lines 3, 12, 21, 30, 39 ft from the left deck edge (3 + 4 × 9); deck width 42 ft.
- Bays "9, -2, 9, 9": error "Bay 2 spacing must be a positive number." on `xs.bays.1`; spans "100, 125, 100": 4 support skews.
### How verified
- `node tests/engine/run.mjs psbridge-model`: 6 tests pass (defaults, validation by path, save/load with `psbeam.*`/`sbd2.*` keys
  untouched, unreadable backup and storage-full, export/import and old files refused, the page's script list / relative paths / CDN pins
  equal to the steel app's / no steel key or namespace in the code).
- `node tests/check-syntax.mjs` (all files) passes; `node tests/smoke/ps-bridge-skeleton.mjs`: 50 checks pass (1400 px layout and every
  tab, autosave and reload, only `psb2.*` keys written, seeded `psbeam.inputs.v1`/`sbd2.project.current` byte-identical, error mark and
  link, unreadable backup, 390 px stacked with no sideways scroll, 0 console errors). `tests/smoke/home-projects.mjs`, `tests/smoke/home-sync.mjs`,
  `tests/engine/project-registry.test.mjs` pass with the new card.
### Other copies
- The copied steel files above (listed for the `shared/` move). The old `Prestressed Bridge Design.html` is unchanged.
### Open items
- Next: PR 2a (engine moved in verbatim + Node parity harness, plan §3).
